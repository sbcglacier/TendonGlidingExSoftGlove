This repository includes the work done for my PhD 
The file Chung_ScaleFactors_F2.m calculates the scale factors for OpenSim for the index finger.
The file Chung_ScaleFactors_F3.m calculates the scale factors for OpenSim for the mid finger.
The file Chung_ScaleFactors_F4.m calculates the scale factors for OpenSim for the ring finger.
The file Chung_ScaleFactors_F5.m calculates the scale factors for OpenSim for the little finger.
The folder OpenSim_FingerMeshData contains the mesh files needed for the matlab files used to determine the OpenSim scale factors.

The file Apex_mesh_create_3Chambers.py is used to create the actuator in Apex.
The file Marc_setup_3Chambers.py is used to setup the chambers after the Apex mesh files have been created.
The SensitivityAnalysis.ipynb calculates the moments and bending angles from data gathered from Marc/Mentat.
